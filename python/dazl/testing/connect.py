    """
    A helper function for connecting to a ledger as a brand new party. This isn't normally useful
    outside of tests, where having creating new parties for each test helps keep test data isolated.

    Like the :func:`dazl.ledger.connect` function, all parameters are optional, and if unspecified,
    get their default values from the environment.

    This function can NOT be used with ledgers that require authentication since it has no way to
    ask a token granter for an appropriate token for the newly allocated party.

    :param url:
        The URL of the ledger to connect to. This ledger MUST NOT require authentication!
    :type url: str
    :param read_as:
        Extra parties to for which read-as access should be granted.
    :type read_as: str or Collection[str]
    :param act_as:
        Extra parties to for which act-as access should be granted. The created party is added to
        this list.
    :type read_as: str or Collection[str]
    :param admin:
        ``True`` if the created connection should have "admin" rights; otherwise ``False``. Note
        that in order to allocate parties, an initial connection with admin rights is ALWAYS
        created, and the value of this call only affects the returned connection.
    :type admin: bool
    :param ledger_id:
        The ledger ID to connect to. As with the ``connect`` api, if the target is the gRPC Ledger
        API, then supplying this field is optional, and with an HTTP JSON API server, this field
        must be supplied.
    :type ledger_id: str
    :param dar:
        A path to a file, the contents of the file (as ``bytes``), or a byte buffer that point to a
        DAR that should also be uploaded.
    :type dar: str or bytes or PathLike or BinaryIO
    :param party_count:
        The number of parties (and connections) to create.
    :type party_count: int
    :param identifier_hint:
        A hint to the backing participant. Note that the Daml ledger is free to ignore this
        hint entirely. If `party_count` is greater than 1, then
    :type identifier_hint: str
    :param display_name:
        A human-readable name that corresponds to the allocated ``Party``.
    :return:
        An asynchronous context manager that returns one or more :class:`ConnectionWithParty`
        objects.
