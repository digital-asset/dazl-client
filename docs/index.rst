dazl: DA client library for Python
==================================

Version |release|

Dependencies
------------

You will need Python 3.6 or later and a Daml Ledger.

Getting Started
---------------

This section assumes that you already have a running ledger with the standard `daml new` model
loaded, and have imported `dazl`.

Connect to the ledger and submit a single command:

.. literalinclude:: ../python/tests/unit/test_docs.py
   :language: python
   :pyobject: test_send_single_command
   :lines: 2-

Connect to the ledger as a single party, print all contracts, and close:

.. literalinclude:: ../python/tests/unit/test_docs.py
   :language: python
   :pyobject: test_read
   :lines: 2-

Connect to the ledger using asynchronous callbacks:

.. literalinclude:: ../python/tests/unit/test_docs.py
   :language: python
   :pyobject: test_read_using_callback
   :lines: 2-

Code
----

Build-time dependencies are handled using `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_.
